# Beta / Testing

### Thank you for your interest in MediaMarkup.

**Beta** software refers to computer software that is still being tested and/or has not yet been officially released.

This means some aspects of our MediaMarkup are still in progress, contains a few bugs and some aspects subject to change or further development.

The application is secure, stable and usable, we are just not quite ready for the official launch yet.

Most testing has been driven via the API with customers integrating their own applications, this aspect of the application is the most mature and is working in production for some Beta clients.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please see [this case study](https://medium.com/mediamarkup/case-study-qmuli-api-integration-f34a093149f9) on how the API is already being used.
{% endhint %}

We hope early adopters will help test our application before we launch. All Beta users will have free access until we launch or they feel they can run the application in production. Early adopters that use and provide feedback will benefit from a hugely discounted deal after we officially launch.

### Basic RoadMap

We are very busy working on key aspects of the application to ensure we are providing a secure, stable application with features that users need, whilst keeping things simple and straight forward. We are currently working on the following :

* [ ] Updated Security, full re-write of the User management and OAuth integration \(in progress\)
* [ ] Annotation Tool And API \(continual development based on feedback\)
* [ ] Front-end usablility for non API Customers \(in progress\)
* [ ] HTML based Annotations \(todo\)
* [ ] Removing the custom subdomain to simplify switching accounts \(in progress\)

We consider all feedback, comments and suggestions and we beleive a company will only succeed having  exceptional customer support. Please contact us if you have any questions.

We are also logging updates, please see the [release notes here](../faqs/release-notes.md)

_**Note:**_ ****_**We will more than likely clear down uploaded files and data before launch, but will notify users if/when this happens. We will however be migrating all files and data used by paying customers using MediaMarkup for production.**_
